MobileRedirect
==============

This is a javascript/jQuery script that will redirect to a mobile site if a cookie is not found. If they came from the mobile site they will be shown an option to go back to the mobile site.

This script works on pxiel size and not device detection so anything under 600px will be re-directed. There are also functions that allow you to delete the cookie.
